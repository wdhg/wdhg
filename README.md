NAME
       wdhg - MEng computing student at Imperial College London


SYNOPSIS
       wdhg [--help] [--eat food] [--code language] [--sleep]


DESCRIPTION
       wdhg  is  a  self  aware program that writes software in many languages, including Haskell, Java, C, and
       Rust.  It does this either at its discretion, or when offered payment (e.g. in the form of a salary).


STANDARDS
       The wdhg command conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'') and obeys all UK domestic legislation.


BUGS
       Sometimes wdhg can forget what it was doing when entering a new environment.

       When running ``wdhg --sleep'', it can sometimes exit a few hours early.  In this event, try to  keep  it
       fed, hydrated, and avoid all annoyances.


TIPS
       Providing wdhg food via the --eat option can help resolve issues of hangry.


AUTHOR
       J.  Grant  was  the original author of wdhg.  They released version wdhg 1.0, and was the maintainer for
       versions 1.0 through 17.0.  As of release 18.0, wdhg has become self managed and no longer  requires  an
       active maintainer.
